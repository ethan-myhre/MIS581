# MIS581 Captsone - Evaluating Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Data
Electronic sports (esports) is a rapidly growing multibillion-dollar industry with worldwide appeal. However, as a relatively new industry, research in the field seems to be lacking, and what does exist does not sufficiently approach the subject of competitive gameplay factors that can help players and coaches know what skills to practice to achieve more wins. This is a quantitative study focusing on four areas the author has hypothesized may play a role: map balance, the terrorist team planting the bomb, the damage done to certain player model hitboxes, and the overall difference in equipment value. Utilizing a publicly available dataset consisting of over 410,000 rounds of the game, a statistical analysis using the computer programming language Python shows support for all four of the hypothesized factors. While only four factors are considered here, many other possibilities are contained within the dataset and future research will further define what factors are important for players to increase their win rates.
